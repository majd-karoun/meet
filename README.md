# Meet App

## Overview

Meet App is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React, and developed using a test-driven development (TDD) approach. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

* Filter Events by City
* Show/Hide Event Details
* Specify Number of Events
* Use the App When Offline
* Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen
* Display Charts Visualizing Event Details

## How the App Works


### Secure Communication with Google Calendar

The app talks to Google Calendar using a special key called OAuth. It's like a secret code that lets the app ask Google Calendar for event info. This ensures everything is safe and secure.

### Cloud Magic with AWS

All of this happens in a special cloud place called AWS. AWS makes everything run smoothly. So, with the help of these serverless helpers and the key, the app shows you upcoming events from Google Calendar. You can easily stay informed.
